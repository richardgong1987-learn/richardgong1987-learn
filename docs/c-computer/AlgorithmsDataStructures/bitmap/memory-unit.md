# Memory unit:

## BIT:

- a "bit" is atomic: the smallest unit of storage
- A bit stores just a 0 or 1

### Nibble:

A nibble is a collection of 4 bits.

## Byte:

- One byte = collection of 8 bits
- e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
- One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'

### Kilobyte:

- It is the most common unit of memory which is the smallest of all. But, it is greater than the byte.
- The abbreviation for kilobytes is ‘KB’.
- It contains 1000 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to kibibytes which contain 1024 (2^10) bytes.
- Megabytes usually measures the size of text documents, graphics of websites, individual files, etc.

### Megabyte:

- The abbreviation for megabyte is ‘MB’.
- It contains 1000,000 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to mebibytes which contains 1048576 (2^20) bytes.
- Kilobytes usually measure the size of large files. For example high-resolution images, songs, storage of compact disks, etc.

### Gigabyte

- The abbreviation for the gigabyte is ‘GB’ or ‘gigs’.
- It contains 1000,000,000 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to gibibytes which contain 1073741824 (2^30) bytes.
- Kilobytes usually measure the capacity of storage devices.

### Terabyte:

- The abbreviation for terabytes is ‘TB’.
- It contains onetrillion bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to tebibytes which contains 2^40 bytes.
- Kilobytes usually measure the capacity of large storage devices, for example, HDDs (Hard Disk Drives).

### Petabyte:

- The abbreviation for petabyte is ‘PB’.
- It contains 10^15 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to pebibytes which contains 2^50 bytes.
- Petabytes usually measure the total data storage in large networks or server farms. For example, the data in Google or Facebook data servers is around more than 10 PBs.

### Exabyte:

- The abbreviation for exabyte is ‘EB’.
- It contains 10^18 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to exbibytes which contains 2^60 bytes.
- The exabyte unit is so large that it does not even measure the storage of large cloud servers. Rather, it can be used to measure the amount of data transfer over the internet for a certain time limit.

### Zettabyte:

- The abbreviation for zettabyte is ‘ZB’.
- It contains 10^21 bytes. Besides, it is synonyms to zebibytes which contains 2^70 bytes.
- It can measure a huge amount of data. In fact, the whole data in the world is just a few zettabytes.

### Yottabyte:

- The abbreviation for yottabyte is ‘YB’.
- It contains 10^24 zettabytes. Besides, it is synonyms to yobibytes which contains 2^80 bytes.
- It is a tremendously huge unit of measurement. Therefore, it has no practical use.
